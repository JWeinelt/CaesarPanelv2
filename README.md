## ❓ What is this?

This repository contains the prototype of a web interface that was originally planned as the official panel for [Caesar](https://github.com/JWeinelt/Caesar).  
The goal was to make features such as server management, player overview, file access, and notifications available through a modern web interface.

---

## 📜 Why is it archived?

During development, various challenges arose – including issues with authentication, API compatibility, and resource management.  
The project was eventually **discontinued**, in favor of a new native client strategy (see: [Caesar Client](https://github.com/JWeinelt/Caesar-Panel)).

This version is now kept for **reference purposes** – such as for design ideas or early approaches.
